# CVD_prevention
**Introduction:** 
	
Heart Disease is the leading cause of death according to the CDC. The personal key factors that contribute to a person with heart disease are smoking, BMI, alcohol consumption, previous stroke, physical and mental health, sex, and age. This dataset is used to creat a machine learning model that predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
We think that the variables of smoking and age will impact a person of heart disease more than the others. However our algorithm can make it easier for clinicians to quickly diagnose patients or to simply double check their own findings. Our method is to develop a machine learning model that is a Heart Disease Indicator system. We utilized a decision tree to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on variables mentioned. Then we evaluated and ranked the importance of these indicators in relation to the presence of heart disease.

# Findings
Stroke and Kidney disease have the closest correlation to heart disease in individuals, but are not the only contributing factors. 


# METHOD
# Data Collection and Preprocessing (Python Pandas):

The data set used is in our resources file which can also be found on this link,

We will be using Jupyter notebook for data cleaning and handling missing values
